<h1>What to expect: Collaboration using mural</h1>

<div>
  <h2>Mural</h2>
  <p>When using Mural, the shared board is on a browser.  One person (the driver) shares their browser.  The driver will be editing a text box on the board.  Everyone has the ability to edit the board simultaneously.  Non-drivers should avoid editing the text box the driver is editing.<p><img src="/assets/images/setup/mural.png" class="setupImg"/></p>
   <h2>How does Mural handover work?</h2>
   <p>You will be given a link at the beginning of a session to a shared board.  Alternatively, you can use your Mural board. If someone has an issue with accessing Mural, we employ the <a href="#fallback-rule">one-chance setup / fallback rule</a> </p>
  <p>For a sample driver session (let's say for three minutes)</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><p>the current driver stops editing the text box and unshares their screen</p></li>
    <li><p>the next driver shares their browser and starts editing a text box while listening to directions from the mob</p></li>
  </ul>
  </div>

<div>
  <h2>How do I get ready?</h2>
  <p>Sign up at <a href="https://www.mural.com/" target="_blank">Mural</a> for a free trial.  Try out creating a text box and editing it.  You can try a shared session with members of your team</p>
 

  <h2><a id="fallback-rule"></a>One-chance setup / fallback rule</h2>
  <p><b>In the highly unlikely event that you're unable to use Mural, we employ a <a href="#fallback-rule">one-chance setup / fallback rule</a>.</b> If you have an issue with accessing Mural, you can just watch the shared screen. </p>
</div>
