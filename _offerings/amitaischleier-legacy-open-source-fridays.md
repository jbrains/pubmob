When you work with legacy code, your every move fraught with extra risk, it can be difficult to make room to experiment and learn.
When you live in a codebase, over time it can become difficult to even _perceive_ where experiments and learning could possibly be found.

This is especially unfortunate.
It's precisely legacy code that places the most strenuous demands on your **perceptual acuity**, your **creativity**, and your ruthlessly disciplined **outcome-focused learning**.

Take your head for a stroll.
Play with _someone else's_ legacy code, accompanied by an experienced guide.
See things you might not otherwise see.
Try things you might not otherwise try.
Contribute to software that's widely considered valuable.
Feel pride in your contribution and in our progress from week to week.
Sharpen your vision, refresh your cleverness, stretch, reenergize.
Then return to your own code ready to find new ways forward.
