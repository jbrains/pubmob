<h1>What to Expect</h1>
<p>During a PubMob session, expect to stay engaged as you switch between the role of being a driver&mdash;creating solutions in the computer&mdash;and a navigator, learning as you help other drivers understand where to go. Read on for more information about how to get ready for your PubMob experience.</p>

<div>
  <h2>What are the rules?</h2>
  <p>PubMob follows a simple, core structure:</p>
    <ul class="list outer">
      <li><ul>The navigators are responsible for describing the next increment for a solution to the driver.</ul></li>
      <li><ul>The driver, who controls the keyboard and mouse, listens to the navigator(s) and translates their direction into an appropriate solution in the computer.</ul></li>
      <li><ul>Drivers may not navigate. If they have a brilliant idea, they relinquish the driver's seat, then act as a navigator.</ul></li>
      <li><ul>The driver controls computer input for a short, timed interval.</ul></li>
      <li><ul>We rotate once through each driver in the lineup before repeating the lineup.</ul></li>
    </ul>
  <p>The short rotations keep the session lively and prevent anyone from dominating.</p>
  <p>Beyond the core PubMob structure, most everything else is common sense. Show respect for your {{ site.session-lead-term }} and fellow PubMobbers, and enjoy the experience. Your PubMob {{ site.session-lead-term }} may add a bit of spice to the session with custom guidelines and recommendations for a successful mob.</p>
  <h2>What does a PubMob session feel like?</h2>
  <p>Being a driver may sound intimidating at first, but a core reason we promote mob programming is to minimize the fear factor. When you're in the "hot seat" as a driver (typically for a breezy 3-5 minutes), you're not expected to have all the answers. In fact, you're not expected to have <em>any</em> answers&mdash;your job is to listen and translate.</p>
  <p>You can't quite sit back and relax; it turns out that listening and translating is a valuable skill all its own. But it does mean that you should never feel pressured or intimidated because you don't have the answers.</p>
  <p>The feedback we usually hear: Mob programming is fun, it's productive, and it goes by fast.</p>

  <h2>How to get ready for your PubMob session</h2>
  <p>Our PubMob {{ site.session-lead-term }}s are individuals with strong, extensive experience in helping others develop software. As such, they'll have likely settled on a preferred mechanism for facilitating their sessions. When you sign up for a PubMob session, make sure you read the description for the specified mob programming technique, which includes key information about how to get ready for that type of PubMob session.</p>
  <p>Currently, our {{ site.session-lead-term }}s will be using one of the following techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><a href="/setup/mob">Git handover with mob.</a> You'll build software on your own machine and use Git to share your changes.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="/setup/anydesk">Remote control with AnyDesk.</a> You'll be provided access to a remote desktop that provides fast access and minimal lag.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="/setup/cyberdojo">cyber-dojo.</a> You'll work in a simple, web-based development environment that minimizes the need for extensive IDE knowledge.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="/setup/mural">Mural.</a> You'll work with a collaboration tool that allows you to interact with an advanced whiteboard.</p></li>
  </ul>
