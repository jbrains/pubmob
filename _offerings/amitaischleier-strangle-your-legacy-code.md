summary-blurb-80-words: "<p>This hands-on session is for developers who work with valuable code that doesn't feel easy or safe to change. That's a lot of us. We'll get to know the Strangler application pattern by test-driving new features into real (and semi-famous) legacy code -- without needing to touch that code at all. By the end of the session, we're familiar with the basic workings of a Strangler, when to consider using one, and what to watch out for when we do.</p>"

Given an ancient codebase that makes refactoring risky and expensive, how do you clear a path to continued delivery? The old wisdom says the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is today. But if you already have a gnarled old source tree, preserve your software investment by planting a Strangler: a pattern for reaping continuous value from your existing system while growing new functionality alongside it. We'll define our terms, meet some legacy code and its Strangler (both open source), then test-drive new features into the system. You'll leave with a powerful strategy for extending the useful life of working, valuable software -- especially when it's hard to change.
