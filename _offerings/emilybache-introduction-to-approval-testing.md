summary-blurb-80-words: "<p>Instead of writing a lot of assertions, Approval Testing gives you another approach. You print the state of the object you want to check, and verify it against a previously approved version. Any difference fails the test. It's a great technique for example when the existing code lacks test cases and has poor structure, making adding unit tests challenging. You might call that \"legacy code.\"</p>"
