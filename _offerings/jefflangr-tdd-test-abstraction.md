If you scan GitHub for projects with unit tests, you'll find that most tests leave a lot to be desired. They're repetitive, cluttered with unnecessary detail, and in general hard to follow. "Why does this test expect the result it does?"

Chances are good your own system's tests are similarly challenging.

Well-written tests, instead, can also act as trustworthy documents that concisely describe the unit behaviors of your system. You can read them in just moments and understand immediately the intent they describe.

In this session, you'll learn the difference between tests that quickly pay off time & time again, versus tests that demand too much time to simply understand what they do. You'll work through whittling some difficult tests down into simple declarations that will help everyone going forward (including you!).
