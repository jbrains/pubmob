<blockquote>The mob programming practice really works well. It’s especially easy to learn in a remote setting. You just can not bump someone aside and take over. Me and the rest of our team really enjoyed Jon as a trainer and person. — Lead Engineer</blockquote>

Test-driven development is easy to describe. But the simple rules combine to form a way of working that has subtle nuances. To focus on how these rules work together, let’s use the simplest programming puzzle: FizzBuzz.

You’ll learn: The red-green-refactor cycle of TDD, and the Three Laws of TDD.

You and others in this session will take turns. We’ll be working together on the same project, using Swift on Xcode 12.

Your {{ site.session-lead-term }} will provide you with specific build instructions to ensure you're ready to 
hit the ground running.
